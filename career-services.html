For universities, helping students find good jobs after college is critical to helping them repay any debt they incur and build a loyal alumni base that will support the university. Reinventing a university’s Career Services department so that it can fulfill these demands is imperative.

									<i>Implemented the HIRE Education Program, a customized career development plan</i><br /><br />

									HIRE Education encompasses the hundreds of programs Career Services offers to help Bentley’s students develop the skills and contacts that pave the way for professional success. Its customized, four-year career development plan is designed to help students during every phase of their Bentley career to prepare for professional success. HIRE Education has four key stages: Explore, Experiment, Experience, and Excel. Each one ties directly to a year in school. Students can engage at different times or revisit certain parts of the program when they wish. The goal is for students to acquire lifelong professional development skills. All stages of HIRE Education develop the core aspects of students’ job search strategy: creating a resume, conducting informational interviews, networking, developing an “elevator pitch,” practicing interviews, and more. Bentley was ranked #4 on the Princeton Review’s list of “Best Career Center Services” in 2014.

									<i>A global leader in co-operative education, the Waterloo co-op program has a student employment rate of 97%</i><br /><br />

									The University of Waterloo operates the largest post secondary co-op program of its kind in the world. Co-operative education combines academic studies with work experience. A co-op program allows students to gain up to two years of relevant work experience. Study terms alternate with work terms to create a study-work sequence. Study-work sequences vary between programs. A work term is usually four months long, but some programs have double work terms that are eight months long. Waterloo offers more than 122 co-op programs, and more than 60% of undergraduate students are enrolled in the co-op program.

									Students in Northeastern’s co-op program alternate between semesters of academic study and semesters of full-time employment in positions related to their academic and career interests in the U.S. or globally. Students start with a required co-op course that prepares them to succeed in their co-op experiences. Their first co-op opportunity typically begins in the second semester of their sophomore year, and students can complete up to three co-ops in the course of a five-year program, or, if they choose, up to two co-ops in the course of a four-year program. Northeastern provides a broad-based network of support that helps students prepare for and get the most from its co-op program, including an academic advisor, a co-op coordinator, and, if applicable, an international co-op counselor.
