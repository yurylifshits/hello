						<i>Implemented the HIRE Education Program, a customized career development plan</i><br /><br />

						HIRE Education encompasses the hundreds of programs Career Services offers to help Bentley’s students develop the skills and contacts that pave the way for professional success. Its customized, four-year career development plan is designed to help students during every phase of their Bentley career to prepare for professional success. HIRE Education has four key stages: Explore, Experiment, Experience, and Excel. Each one ties directly to a year in school. Students can engage at different times or revisit certain parts of the program when they wish. The goal is for students to acquire lifelong professional development skills. All stages of HIRE Education develop the core aspects of students’ job search strategy: creating a resume, conducting informational interviews, networking, developing an “elevator pitch,” practicing interviews, and more. Bentley was ranked #4 on the Princeton Review’s list of “Best Career Center Services” in 2014.
