						<i>A global leader in co-operative education, the Waterloo co-op program has a student employment rate of 97%</i><br /><br />

						The University of Waterloo operates the largest post secondary co-op program of its kind in the world. Co-operative education combines academic studies with work experience. A co-op program allows students to gain up to two years of relevant work experience. Study terms alternate with work terms to create a study-work sequence. Study-work sequences vary between programs. A work term is usually four months long, but some programs have double work terms that are eight months long. Waterloo offers more than 122 co-op programs, and more than 60% of undergraduate students are enrolled in the co-op program.
